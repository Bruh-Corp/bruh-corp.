        Hiii miss, 
        I don't even know where to begin, or what to say but I guess more than anything I'm grateful to have been your student. You were an amazing mentor and we couldn't have asked for a better person to guide us through some tough years of hlookup and biometric identifications. Always a special place in our hearts, I wish the very best for you wherever you go. Thank you for everything üíó

      <div>Thank you for your great lessons, witty sarcasm, not frowning upon our endless repetitions of pseudocode explanations and countless memories in such a short while! I wish you the best of luck for your future, and I'm sure your prospective students are hella lucky!

        Graves are elegantly designed to take up as less space as possible, plain commercial ones anyway. While some may
        imagine it horrible to be deposited beneath a shitload of dirt and pebbles, only protected by a biodegradable
        and groaning slab of wood or stone, both of which are biodegradable by nature almighty, the experience might as
        well be otherwise. There is an expression in common speech, 'buried alive', which seems to be the root of our
        loathing for being ensepulchered, and is wholly unjustified.
