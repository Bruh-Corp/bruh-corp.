        Don't know where to start, but to the least I can say, its been amazing to have had you as a teacher. You've always inspired us to do better than our capabilities and somehow made excel formulas sound so doable (although they def were not). Love your attitude of not sugar-coating anything and telling us that we can always find different methods to solving things. I'm gonna miss you! Wishing you the best for the future, and once again, Thank you!

        I don't even know where to begin, or what to say but I guess more than anything I'm grateful to have been your student. You were an amazing mentor and we couldn't have asked for a better person to guide us through some tough years of hlookup and biometric identifications. Always a special place in our hearts, I wish the very best for you wherever you go. Thank you for everything 💗

        Such an untimely goodbye for such an unbelievable teacher. I'm going to cherish all those classes you taught so passionately. It's been an incredible ride with all the ups and downs, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. It meant the world to have you by my side last year, Year 11 n' all.  May your path ahead be filled with joy. Thank you for everything.

        Hi miss. It's been a long time since you've seen me, but I've heard a lot about you. I'm soooo envious of your classes because they look soooo much fun, especially that one instance where you allegedly made Talha [Ijaz] exercise in class. I still miss your classes from years ago because you made them so exciting and energetic. However, I feel like you've been teaching me forever. It was all those years ago when you pushed me to finish my game submission, that permanently left a mark on me. I don't know about you, but I'll remember your motivating words and kindness for my entire life. They'll be part of my career and every success I ever have. Thank you for being more than an amazing teacher and motivating me to be my best 🧡 I wish you the best on your journey, just like you always wished the best for students.
