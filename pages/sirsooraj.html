        I’ve been extremely fortunate to have a teacher like you. Without you, I wouldn’t have enjoyed computer science the way I do now. Without you, I wouldn’t have looked forward to computer science classes the way I do now, and without you, it would be difficult to be the student I am today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you have done for me and all your students. I wish you the best of luck as you write a new chapter in your life. Stay safe and stay happy.        <br>

        Good-byes are hard, when it comes to teachers you admire, who teach well and guide above all, than just stuff concepts in your head. Thank you for your efforts Sir! it's truly been an incredible year, and CS classes were always fun with you, as unlike most teachers, you are realistic and actually listen to your students. I wish you the best for your future endeavors, and your future students are so damn lucky. 
        So fortunate to be a student, even for a short while, as I had always heard great things about you!

        I hold great respect for your teaching craftsmanship, in this vast field of CS it's a needle in a haystack chance to be taught and mentored by an experience like yours to be programmatic and perspicacious with how we perceive many things in this field. I've learned ample in such little time in our classes, much to hold great a deference for it in my own passions.
